The quickest way to generate pyramids (overviews) and statistics for a large number of images is to use the server. It has fast disks and 
we can run multiple images at once. We use the GDAL toolset.

Step 1:
Set permission so the directory containing the images is writeable by the logged in user

Step 2:
Run the following commands. This defines the command needed to add the pyramids as a function that can be called from the shell.
Alter the command parameters  if necessary e.g. to change levels or compression, select the files we want to run on, and change 
the number of parallel operations (this will do 10).

f() { gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW --config USE_RRD NO --config TILED YES $@ 2 4 8 16 32 64 128;}
export -f f
ls *Data.tif | x args -P 10 -n 1 -I{} bash -c f\ \{\}

or on windows:
dir /B *.tif|ppx2 -P 6 -I {} gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW --config USE_RRD NO --config TILED YES {} 2 4 8 16 32 64 128
where -P 6 specifies the number of processes to do at once and {} after -I means "replace this in the following command with the filename"

Step 3:
The same can be done for generating statistics. 
The GDAL command for doing this is actually the gdalinfo command; asking it to report statistics will generate them 
if they don't exist. We don't actually want to see them, so just redirect to null.

s() { gdalinfo -stats $@ >/dev.null;}
export -f s
ls *Data.tif | xargs -P 10 -n 1 -I{} bash -c f\ \{\}

Step 4:
Don't forget the restrictions on how much data can be added to the server each day (250Gb). The pyramids generated 
all count towards this!


We can also use this approach to translate a large number of tiff files to a different format, for example to translate all uncompressed files in one of Dan's "cubes"
Note the -I % just tells XArgs to look for a % symbol and replace that with whatever the input from the pipe is

find *.tif | xargs -n 1 -P 6 -I % gdal_translate -co "COMPRESS=LZW" -co "TILED=YES" -co "PREDICTOR=2" -co "BIGTIFF=YES" -co "INTERLEAVE=BAND" -co "SPARSE_OK=TRUE" % /srv/data/hsg/output_dir/%

Or to translate 64  bit data to 32 bit - if the nodata is set to an extreme value that can't be represented in Float32 then we need to reset it, gdal_translate can't do this so use gdalwarp instead:

find *.tif | xargs -n 1 -P 6 -I % gdalwarp -wo NUM_THREADS=4 -wo OPTIMIZE_SIZE=TRUE -co COMPRESS=LZW -co TILED=YES -co PREDICTOR=2 -co BIGTIFF=YES -dstnodata -9999 -ot Float32 % /srv/data_pit/hsg/output_dir/%
