Thumbnail generation

The thumbnails used on the Portal have mostly been generated with the same extent and size, to give a consistent look.

Occasionally you might need to do something fancy in the image which might mean you need to export it from ArcMap.

However in most cases you could just use the image service itself to request an image of the appropriate dimensions. 

This would be an appropriate URL query to do that - append this text to the ImageServer URL:

/exportImage?bbox=-50%2C-45%2C100%2C55&bboxSR=&size=800%2C532&imageSR=&time=1199145600000%2C1199836800000&format=jpgpng&pixelType=F32&noData=&noDataInterpretation=esriNoDataMatchAny&interpolation=+RSP_BilinearInterpolation&compression=&compressionQuality=&bandIds=&mosaicRule=&renderingRule=&f=image

This will generate an image of 800*532 pixels which is a clean multiple of 200*133, the actual required thumbnail size. Requesting the image at this smaller size doesn't work for higher-resolution image services as it seems to be too much of a downscaling for the result to be visible.

The extent includes Africa, and a bit of S America, Europe, and Asia, just to illustrate that these areas are also covered. It selects images for one month in 2008.
