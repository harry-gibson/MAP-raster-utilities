    "\n",
    "Categorical rasters can be aggregated to produce one class proportion and one like adjacency grid for each of the input values, and a single majority grid. This assumes (requires) that the input grids have a small-ish number of unique values, and are in unsigned 8 bit integer format (it was written for the MCD12Q1 BRDF landcover data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code has been written to read input rasters of theoreticlly unlimited size, which are read in tiles to build up the output coarser / smaller grids; memory use is determined by the size of the output files (and the number of categories, i.e. output files that are created)."
